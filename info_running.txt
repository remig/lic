** Requirements for running Lic from source: **

- Python, any version *before* 3.0

- Qt version 4.6.3 or greater.  There's a bug in Qt 4.6.2 and earlier that make Lic *not* work:
http://bugreports.qt.nokia.com/browse/QTBUG-7880

- PyQt, any version that works with the above Python & Qt.

- PyOpenGL, any version

- Python Image Libary (PIL), any version

The source includes a PyDev .project file, if you have Eclipse & PyDev handy.

** Source tree overview **

Lic.py contains the main entry point and window application code.

LicInstructions.py contains the main Instructions class, which maintains the
state of a single instruction book.

LicCustomPages.py contains the important Page class, plus TitlePage and
PartListPage subclasses.

LicModel.py contains the other basic classes you'd expect, which each represent
one 'thing' within in an instruction book (Step, CSI, PLI, etc).

LicBinaryReader & Writer contain all of the binary load / save stuff.

LicGraphicsWidget contains the important QGraphicScene subclass, which is
responsible for the physical display of an instruction book on a portion of the
application window.

LicTreeModel contains the QAbstractItemModel subclass which tracks the data
model for the navigation tree.  The tree widget itself is trivial, and lives in
Lic.py

LicUndoActions holds - you guessed it - all of the code for each custom
undo / redo action.

LicDialogs contains every single dialog subclass used by Lic.  I like all that
nasty UI widget code in one spot.
